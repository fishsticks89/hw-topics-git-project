1.  Did you code stage() / how well does it work?
My stage calls the addBlob() and addDir() methods already present within Michael's code, throwing proper exceptions where nessesary. I have tested it extensively and the method itself works perfectly. I haven't caught any major bugs in the addBlob() or addDir() methods yet, so I would assume they work as well.

2.  Did you code commit() / how well does it work?


3. Did you do checkout / how well does it work?
4. What bugs did find / which of em did you fix?
